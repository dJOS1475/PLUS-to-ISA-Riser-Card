# PLUS-to-ISA-Riser-Card
Tandy 1000 EX / HX PLUS to ISA Riser Card for systems without the OEM memory expansion

This PLUS-ISA Riser Card allows you to add Half-height, Half-length Industry standard 8-Bit ISA cards to Tandy 1000 EX / HX Machines that lack a Tandy PLUS-RAM memory expansion Board.

I made these so that folks can upgrade their classic Tandy computers even if they dont have the Memory expansion. This allows you to add boards like the Lo-tech Compact Flash IDE HDD controller, Lo-tech 1MB Ram Expansion or RS232 Serial Boards etc.
